# **Lunar Lander - Santa’s Chimney Landing** 🎅🎄  

## **Overview**  
This is a **Lunar Lander-style** game where you control Santa as he descends from the sky. Your goal is to **safely land on a chimney** while avoiding dangerous flames (🔥). The game challenges your ability to control acceleration, fuel consumption, and precise landings!

## **How to Play**  
- **Left Arrow (⬅️)**: Move Santa to the left  
- **Right Arrow (➡️)**: Move Santa to the right  
- **Avoid flames**: If Santa touches a flame, the mission fails!

- **Gravity**: Santa naturally falls downward due to gravity.  
- **Acceleration**: Moving left or right **gradually accelerates** Santa instead of instantly stopping when you release a key.
